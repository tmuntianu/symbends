# symbends

Symbends generates symmetric bends, a special kind of almost-knot described by
Roger Miles in his book, [Symmetric Bends](https://www.amazon.com/Symmetric-Bends-Lengths-Knots-Everything/dp/9810221940),
using a self-avoiding walk algorithm that has been "broken" to generate what we
call "semi-self-avoiding walks."

`walks.py` is taken nearly verbatim from [gabsen's SAW repo](https://github.com/gabsens/SelfAvoidingWalk).
